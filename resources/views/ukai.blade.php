            Keishin Ukai (Japanese: 烏養うかい 繋心けいしん Ukai Keishin) is the current coach of Karasuno High Boys' Volleyball Club. 
            He is also an alumnus and former player on the team, having played as a setter.
            <br><br>
            Ukai's behavior is fairly typical of a man in his 20s. He smokes and drinks and is willing to speak casually about alcohol 
            to minors, using terms like "a first gulp of beer" to explain a volleyball tactic to Karasuno. He is quite competitive, 
            agreeing to coach Karasuno only so he could beat Nekoma in the practice match and then staying on because of challenges 
            he made with Nekomata. Ukai appears lazy and cranky, spending most of his time at work reading a newspaper with his 
            legs on the counter or yelling at people for being too loud.
            <br><br>
            However, he's shown to have strong coaching skills and is a hardworking individual. Ukai chose to change his work schedule 
            to a much earlier time in the morning to make up for the time he takes off to coach Karasuno. It's also been noted that 
            in high school and college, Ukai excelled in mentoring underclassmen and had strong analysis skills of opponents. He 
            also said that he wasn't very good at studies to Hinata when he asked Ukai to help him study. While at work, Ukai 
            would yell at high school students and remark that he's out of a product without bothering to check, but he does have 
            a kind side as he gave Tanaka, Kageyama, and Hinata free energy bars.
