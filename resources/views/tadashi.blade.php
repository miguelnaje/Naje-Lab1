            Tadashi Yamaguchi (Japanese: 山口やまぐち 忠ただし Yamaguchi Tadashi) was a first-year student at Karasuno High. 
            He was a middle blocker and pinch server for the Boys' Volleyball Team. During his third-year, he became the 
            team captain. He is currently a college student and is planning to work for a home electronics company in 
            Miyagi once he graduates. 
            <br><br>
            Yamaguchi is a pretty shy person who relies on others early on, most likely stemmed from being bullied because 
            of his appearance. Despite this, Yamaguchi is generally a nice person but does tend to join Tsukishima in teasing 
            others, mainly Kageyama and Hinata. He does show that he is a loyal friend and a supportive teammate. Yamaguchi can 
            at times be seen defending Tsukishima from things he believes were insults toward his friend.
            <br><br>
            Originally, Yamaguchi constantly doubted his abilities and had difficulty handling his nerves. It was through 
            hard work and seeking mentorship through Shimada that he was able to better his skills and become more 
            confident. By the time Karasuno had their rematch against Aoba Johsai in the semifinals, Yamaguchi has made 
            exceptional progress in both his gameplay and emotions.
