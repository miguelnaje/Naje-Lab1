            only to Nishinoya and Tanaka. For the most part, Hinata is very simpleminded which sometimes causes him to 
            make rash decisions. However, he is also shown to be quite observant. He is capable of reading social cues 
            and can be incredibly empathetic toward others' struggles. As such, he often says just what others need to 
            hear to push themselves in the right direction. He is also noted to be a natural schmoozer, a quality that his 
            teammates occasionally use to win someone over such as when Nishinoya agreed to help with Hinata's receives 
            after being flattered by the first-year. His friendly and straightforward personality allows him to befriend 
            even the quietest of people effortlessly, such as Kenma from Nekoma High and Aone from Date Tech High.
