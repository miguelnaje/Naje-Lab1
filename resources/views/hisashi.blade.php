            Hisashi Kinoshita (Japanese: 木下きのした 久志ひさし Kinoshita Hisashi) was a second-year student at Karasuno 
            High. He was one of the substitute wing spikers and pinch servers for the Boys' Volleyball Team. As of 2018, 
            he is working for a train company.
            <br><br>
            Kinoshita has short, spiky light brown hair and large narrowed eyes. He is average in height and is the 
            shortest second-year apart from Nishinoya.
            <br><br>
            Kinoshita is a kind although somewhat shy individual. He gets along relatively well with his team and is not afraid to 
            occasionally poke fun at them; such as mocking Tanaka for stripping off his shirt during the first-years match.
            <br><br>
            When playing volleyball, he's very anxious when it comes to his own abilities and constantly worries about 
            whether he's good or not even though he has been noted to have an "uncanny knack of putting points on the 
            board" by Ukai. Even though he isn't a regular, he is very supportive of his team and can seen wholeheartedly 
            cheering for them during matches. Kinoshita is shown to be hard working in wanting to perfect his jump float 
            serve to the point that Yamaguchi felt nervous about being replaced as the regular pinch server.
