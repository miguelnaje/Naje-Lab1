            Kazuhito Narita (Japanese: 成田なりた 一仁かずひと Narita Kazuhito) is a second-year student at Karasuno High. 
            He plays on the Boys' Volleyball Club as a middle blocker. As of 2018, he is working for a realty firm.
            <br><br>
            Like Tanaka, he has a shaved head except his hair appears much darker and doesn't have a widow's peak. He is 
            tall and has a lean build. He has wide brown eyes and narrow eyebrows that match his hair color. 
            <br><br>
            Some time after high school, Narita has let his hair grow out slightly and he now wears glasses.
            <br><br>
            Narita appears to be a calm, friendly person who doesn't get riled up too easily. He also appears to enjoy 
            occasionally teasing Tanaka or his other teammates.
            <br><br>
            He joined the Karasuno boys' volleyball team in his first year of high school, but temporarily left with 
            Ennoshita and Kinoshita shortly after Ikkei Ukai returned to the team as they were unable to keep up with the 
            harsh training methods and felt the club was not fun anymore. However, they regretted their decisions and 
            came back but by that time, Ikkei was hospitalized again. This past led them to call themselves the 
            "The Ungrateful Second Years."
