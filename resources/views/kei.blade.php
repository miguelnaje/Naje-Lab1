            Kei Tsukishima (Japanese: 月島つきしま 蛍けい Tsukishima Kei) is a first-year at Karasuno High. He plays as one 
            of the starting middle blockers on the boys' volleyball team.
            <br><br>
            He is currently a college student as well as a middle blocker for the Sendai Frogs, a Division 2 team in the 
            V League, and will start work at the Sendai City Museum after graduating college. He is the younger brother of Akiteru 
            Tsukishima.
            <br><br>
            Tsukishima is very blunt and will sometimes rile his teammates up due to his antagonistic nature and sometimes other teams because of his casual smug attitude, 
            taking pride in and relishing when his opponents see him as a nuisance as seen with Tendō and Shirabu.
            <br><br>
            Although Tsukishima maintains a persona of someone who shows little interest in anything and wouldn't do something 
            he didn't like or enjoy, he does truly enjoy volleyball. He initially refrained from putting too much effort into 
            volleyball and being too passionate about it out of fear of suffering from the same fate as his brother. However, 
            after his confrontation with Yamaguchi and hearing Bokuto's inspirational words in the Tokyo training camp, he started 
            to take the sport more seriously and finally found his passion and motivation for volleyball when he blocked Ushijima.
