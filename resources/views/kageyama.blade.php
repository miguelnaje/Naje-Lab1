            Tobio Kageyama (Japanese: 影山かげやま 飛雄とびお Kageyama Tobio) is the deuteragonist of the Haikyū!! series. 
            <br><br>
            He was chosen to train at the All-Japan youth training camp during his first year of high school and joined 
            the V. League as soon as he graduated. He became a part of Japan's national volleyball team at the age of 19, 
            participating in the Rio Olympics in 2016. In November 2018, he was playing as a setter for the Japanese 
            V-League Division 1 team Schweiden Adlers. Currently, he is a member of Ali Roma, an Italian professional team 
            in Italy's Serie A.
            <br><br>
            Perpetually sullen, arrogant, and undeniably short-tempered, Kageyama originally came off as a typical 
            overbearing perfectionist, caring only about winning and completely disregarding the opinions and well-being 
            of his teammates. His habit of complaining about their performance and barking orders at them eventually led 
            the other players in Kitagawa Daiichi to nickname him the "King of the Court," a constant reminder of the 
            oppressive, egocentric attitude he demonstrated during his volleyball career in junior high.
            <br><br>
            Despite his inability to properly socialize, he sincerely wishes to do his best and is extremely passionate 
            and dedicated when it comes to volleyball, to the point where he gets overly excited about nearly every 
            successful move he pulls off with Hinata.
