            Hitoka Yachi (Japanese: 谷や地ち 仁ひと花か Yachi Hitoka) was a first-year student at Karasuno High. She joined the 
            boys' volleyball club partway through the year as the second manager. As of 2018, she is a college student and 
            will begin working at an ad design company in Tokyo once she graduates.
            <br><br>
            Yachi is shown to be paranoid with an overactive imagination, causing her to be intimidated by others a lot, 
            and then having to apologize for being judgmental based on appearances and first impressions. She had to 
            apologize to Hinata for thinking he was a manager because he was short, then to Coach Ukai when she thought 
            he was a fanboy of Kiyoko that may be trying to kill her. She is also very timid and flustered easily which 
            is shown when she blushes and covers her eyes when the volleyball team changes into their uniforms in front 
            of her. She later has become better at overcoming it by voicing the fact that she is nervous, something she 
            told Yamaguchi when he became nervous about facing Seijoh again.
            <br><br>
            She seems to underestimate her own importance and deems herself incapable even though she has a lot of good 
            qualities as Hinata points out later. She is quite clumsy and gets nervous easily but always takes care of 
            others and tries to cheer them up if they are in a bad mood.
