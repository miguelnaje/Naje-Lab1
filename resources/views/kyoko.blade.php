            Kiyoko Shimizu (Japanese: 清水しみず 潔子きよこ Shimizu Kiyoko) was a third-year student at Karasuno High, as 
            well as one of the managers for the Karasuno boy's volleyball team for majority of the series. As of November 
            2018, she is married to Ryūnosuke Tanaka and has changed her name to Kiyoko Tanaka 
            (Japanese: 田中たなか 潔子きよこ Tanaka Kiyoko).
            <br><br>
            Quiet and reserved at first glance, Kiyoko is generally known for her strict and straightforward disposition 
            due to the simple fact that she's serious and passionate about her position as the volleyball club's team manager.
            <br><br>
            Although she appears aloof for the most part, she is shown to care a lot about the team members in the 
            volleyball club. Even going as far as to fix and wash up Karasuno's banner in order to boost up the team's 
            morale. Surprisingly enough, she's shown to be extremely shy, especially when it comes to giving a speech of 
            encouragement, such as when she wished the volleyball team to do their best.
            <br><br>
            After Kiyoko recruits Hitoka Yachi as manager and that she later joins the volleyball team, she begins to open 
            herself up a lot more and is seen smiling and talking more often, even cracking jokes to let Yachi ease up 
            whenever the latter feels anxious.
