            Yū Nishinoya (Japanese: 西谷にしのや 夕ゆう Nishinoya Yū) was a second-year student at Karasuno High. He was 
            the libero for the boys' volleyball team and was referred to as "Karasuno's Guardian Deity" by his teammates, 
            for his remarkable skills.
            <br><br>
            Nishinoya can be extremely impatient, excitable and impulsive. As Tanaka puts it, "he simply gets too fired up 
            for his good.". He doesn't bother to filter his words and is therefore prone to blurting out whatever he's 
            thinking in a loud and tactless manner. In-game, however, his attitude changes drastically as he becomes 
            incredibly focused and serious, remaining calm and doing everything in his power to provide the support his team 
            needs until the very end. For this reason, everyone in the volleyball club respects him greatly. He is shown to 
            be incredibly hard-working, once even continuously practicing more than 200 spike-block receives to the point that 
            his legs stopped moving.
            <br><br>
            Although he displays an incredible feat of confidence and fearlessness countless times, Nishinoya admits that 
            he was a "huge scaredy-cat" when he was a kid. He had many fears, which resulted in his grandfather 
            training him so he could overcome those fears, teaching him that behind every fear is a wasted experience, 
            and telling him to never be afraid to ask for help whenever the fear doesn't fade.
