            Kōshi Sugawara (Japanese: 菅原すがわら 孝支こうし Sugawara Kōshi) was a third-year student at Karasuno High. He 
            was the vice captain, a substitute setter, and pinch server for the Boys' Volleyball Team.
            <br><br>
            Being the vice captain, he has a soothing and gentle personality for his teammates and acts as a pillar of support for 
            them. Even though he isn't Karasuno's regular setter anymore, he does not dream of giving up on playing. As such, he 
            encourages himself and all of his teammates to never give up, no matter how rough the situation might be.
            <br><br>
            Sugawara's dedication to volleyball is clear when he decides to continue club activities even when most 
            third-years choose to retire in order to focus on their futures. In a meeting, his teacher asked Sugawara why 
            he's so determined to continue playing even though he's not a starting member, and Sugawara answered that he 
            doesn't want to have regrets in the future.
            <br><br>
            He is also rather proud, although it is very rarely shown. Notable examples are when he said: "Kageyama, from 
            here on out if you start getting bombarded by interviews, you're gonna say 'I learned everything from a 
            magnificent senpai called Sugawara', got it?", and when he bragged about how he came up with the name of 
            Kageyama and Hinata's new technique 'Back Minus'.
